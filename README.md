- 👋 Hi, I’m @Felipe-Novais
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of programming and understanding how most systems work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. It is my first programming language and once I start feeling confortable with it, I'm gonna start studying Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really. I just want to finish the courses that I bought to be able to actually program something good and worthwhile.
- 📫 How to reach me: for now you can text me on discord @blessed#1318.
