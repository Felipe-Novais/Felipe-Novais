- 👋 Hi, I’m @Felipe-Novais
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of programming and understanding how systems work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. It is my second programming language and once I start feeling confortable with it, I'm gonna start studying other subjects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really. I just want to finish the courses that I bought to be able to actually program something good and worthwhile.
